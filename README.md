This repository contains ontologies for an Open Innovation Platform focused on Steel-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Sheet Metal Cutting (SMC) production. These ontologies are designed to be inferred from the MPCCI Ontologies developed by Fraunhofer SCAI.

Purpose: Facilitate knowledge sharing and data integration within the Open Innovation Platform (OIP) for Steel AM and SMC.
Source: Inferred from MPCCI Ontologies by Fraunhofer SCAI.
Documentation: Refer to the following link for the MPCCI ontology documentation: [Link]

You can experiment with the attached notebook (MX3D.ipynb) in a live environment on Google Colab ([link here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eqG2AVu0r5KJivyZxPeOxzbt65Zllxdp#scrollTo=IMemo6g-P63M)).

Inferring Examples: 
PhysicalProcess is extended directly to Additive Manufacturing Process in the MX3D use case.
Continuum is extended with an interface to the products e.g., I-Section and Truss Nodes in the MX3D use case.
